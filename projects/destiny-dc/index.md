# Tales of Destiny DC
This project started on December 13, 2020.

## A Brief History
When this project began, there were two goals:
1. Increase the organization's **Bus Factor**
2. Adopt **Agile Methodologies** for projects

### Bus Factor
The **Bus Factor** is the minimum number of project members needed to *get hit by a bus* before a project is dropped, mostly because no one else has access to code, or is able to understand how to use it.  To prevent projects from getting dropped, open-source contributions has been adopted to (help) ensure continuity, regardless of who takes over.

### Agile Methodologies
Instead of going with a big launch, opting for more frequent and incremental releases helps with getting feedback from the community.  Because of the open-source nature of this project, and a large number of community members who are willing to help, adopting **Agile Methodologies** allows community feedback to be continusouly integrated into future releases.  Having this feedback loop from the community is especailly important for maintaining quality by keeping us accountable for bugs.  By involving everyone in the community, we are able to scale this project to divide and conquer.
