This man also appears in "The Bird in the Cage" [Side-Quest #077](projects/destiny-dc/stahn-guide?id=Side-Quest-077-bird-in-a-cage).

A rowdy Seingald soldier will try to put the moves on Rutee, but an uninterested Rutee immediately rejects him. The rest of the parts of this event have a limited duration for when you can see them, so be sure to check their availability so you don't miss any of them.

This event only appears for a short time, so it's best to complete it PRIOR TO heading to Staylize Temple. Visit the dining room in Seinegald Castle, which is located at the end of the corridor on the left side of the first floor. A child will shout "mother," leading Stahn and the party to wonder for a moment if this child is Mary's (?). In the end, it all turns out to be a misunderstanding.

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Missable-informational?style=for-the-badge&color=red)

The woman shares with the party that her husband, who serves upon the Draconis, has yet to return. When Rutee attempts to tell the woman the fate of the Draconis, Leon intervenes. Leon (?) expresses concern for her husband's safety, but leaves without telling her about the crash. 



![](stahn-guide/sub011_1.png)

While this is the first of eight Side-Quests, there is no specific order in which to view the events staring these three "lens hunters." No items or titles are obtained either, but their antics are worth seeing through to the very end.

Junkland doesn't need to visited until towards the end of the story in case you just want to advance the main plot. However, to view this Side-Quest, you need to visit Junkland very early in the story. Near the armorer in Junkland, Philia is unable to handle the power stench in the air and falls ill. Do not fret - this event has no bearing on her actual status in game.

This event occurs when you talk to the maid at Hugo's mansion in Darilsheid after you have completed "Mother's Face: Leon" (sub 79) and "Rutee" (sub 94). The maid will give you a diary written in her youth by Chris, the mother of Leon and Rutee, and you will be able to look at the contents of the diary, which are a little embarrassing.
